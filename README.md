 <b><u><h2>Twitch stream Jul 26</h2></u></b>
    Learned: 
   
    <!-- * {
        box-sizing: border-box;
        
    }  -->
    - Turning on the hover state in inspect
    - #000000aa <- color and then opacity
    - border-shadow: offset-x offset-y blur-radius spread-radius color
    - Need to review flexbox as it kept getting suggested.

 <b><u><h2>Twitch stream Jul 27</h2></u></b>
- flex - maybe just need to use justify-content & align-items most of the time.
- slap flex on everything
- cannot override parent css. best to assign add new class to existing class
- completed easy version! will start hard version sometime this week
